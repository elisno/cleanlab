        - A boolean `is_issue` value, which is True if we believe this example suffers from the issue in question.
          `is_issue` may be determined by thresholding the severity score (with an a priori determined reasonable threshold value),
          or via some other means (e.g. Confident Learning for flagging label issues).

        - A global value between 0 and 1 summarizing how severe this issue is in the dataset overall
          (e.g. the average severity across all examples in dataset or count of examples where `is_issue=True`).
        - Other interesting `info` about the issue and examples in the dataset,
          and statistics estimated from current dataset that may be reused to score this issue in future data.
          For example, `info` for label issues could contain the:
          confident_thresholds, confident_joint, predicted label for each example, etc.
